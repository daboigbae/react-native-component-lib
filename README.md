#### Run locally for development
To run the test project locally run `yarn change:package:dev` then run `yarn ios` or `yarn android`, 

#### Build library for release
To build the library, run `yarn change:package:prod`, set version in `package.json` then run `yarn build` this will create a `dist` file that will allow you to install the library in your project.

##### Build library for local testing (optional)
To make a test version of the library (.tgz) run `yarn pack`

#### Troubleshooting
If you're getting permission denied on your scripts. Make sure to change their permissions by running `chmod +x bash/change-package-dev.sh ` and `chmod +x bash/change-package-prod.sh`
